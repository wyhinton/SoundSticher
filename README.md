# Sound Stitch

**A specialized audio tool for seamless sample organization and non-destructive audio concatenation**

Sound Stitch addresses a fundamental gap in modern Digital Content Creation (DCC) workflows: the need for fast, intelligent, and non-destructive audio file joining (concatenation) that respects your existing sample organization.

## ðŸŽ¯ **The Problem**

While samples remain a cornerstone of modern music production and sound design, working with them in traditional DAWs involves frustrating limitations:

- **Destructive workflows** that permanently alter your source files
- **Disconnected browsing** - audio joining is separate from file exploration
- **Manual alignment** - clips must be manually positioned next to each other
- **Limited encoding control** over the final joined audio
- **Slow iteration** without real-time preview capabilities
- **Unwanted processing** like time-stretching or beat-matching

## âœ¨ **The Sound Stitch Approach**

Sound Stitch reimagines audio joining as a **non-destructive, folder-based workflow** that aligns with how you already organize samples on your system.

### **Key Features**
- **Real-time audio preview** of combined sequences before export
- **Folder-based organization** - groups naturally map to your existing file structure
- **Automatic clip alignment** - no manual positioning required
- **Non-destructive workflow** - source files remain untouched
- **Adaptive timeline** that adjusts to your combined audio length
- **Fine-grained export control** with multiple format options

### **Export Formats**
- FLAC, AIFF, WAV, and MP3
- Customizable encoding parameters
- Batch processing capabilities

## ðŸŽµ **Use Cases**

### **Sound Designers & Musicians**
- Quickly audition and combine samples from large libraries
- Create seamless audio sequences for film, games, or music
- Generate variations and alternate versions non-destructively

### **Audio Engineers**
- Generate test audio sequences for equipment testing
- Create reference materials and audio examples
- Build custom audio content for technical documentation

### **Podcasters & Content Creators**
- Combine multiple takes into seamless segments
- Create audio snippets and highlights from longer recordings
- Build intro/outro sequences from component elements

## ðŸš€ **Technical Innovation**

**Built with Tauri + Rust + SvelteKit** for optimal performance:
- **Rust backend** handles intensive audio processing and file operations
- **Web-based UI** provides rich visual feedback and intuitive interaction
- **Native file system integration** for seamless local file browsing and management

The real-time combined audio preview system allows you to hear exactly how your sequence will sound before committing to an export - something traditional DAWs struggle to provide efficiently.

## ðŸ”„ **Workflow Philosophy**

Sound Stitch complements rather than replaces your existing DAW workflow. It excels in the specific niche of **sample exploration, auditioning, and intelligent joining** - areas where traditional DAWs are often cumbersome or slow.

Think of it as a specialized tool that sits between your file browser and your DAW, making the journey from scattered audio files to cohesive sequences faster and more intuitive.

## ðŸ”® **Future Vision**

- **Cloud-based storage integration** for team collaboration
- **Procedural audio modification** - automated trimming, gain adjustment, and pitch shifting
- **Advanced selection algorithms** for intelligent sample choosing
- **Cross-platform support** (Windows/Mac primary, Linux future)

**Sound Stitch aims to be a focused, open-source tool that serves the audio community by doing one thing exceptionally well: making audio joining as intuitive as organizing files in folders.**
